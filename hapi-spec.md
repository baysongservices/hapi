Hypermedia Web API - hAPI

Abstract
The proliferation of snowflake web apis of many different types burdens service providers and consumers with unnecessary work to support the custom formats and types.  Utilizing the HTTP protocol as a tunnel, these services fail to leverage many of the protocols native functionalities and properties creating redundant custom solutions for solved issues.

Building upon the single most successful API model, HTTP with HTML, this specification intends to craft strong behavior profiles for HTTP services in order to facilitate the proliferation of generic clients of various hypermedia formats.  Since the internet boom of the late ninties, the general trend of API design has drifted towards completely dynamic, and slowly been pulled back towards statically bound clients and servers.  Positional and large batch integration services were replaced with more dynamic plain XML services.  Plain XML services were replaced by tightly bound and coupled SOAP.  SOAP services were replaced by ReST-ish crud web services.  ReST-ish crud web services are now being actively challenged by statically bound technologies like OAS (Swagger) and gRPC.  The trend is cyclical and clear, without a strong standard for dynamic services, the ease of use and understanding of statically typed interfaces will continue to proliferate.  However as computer systems do not handle the infinite combinations of the semantic web style tools like RDF, this specification creates a static http behavioral profile which in conjunction to an Application Level Profile Semantics (ALPS) and HTTP Protocol binding will provide a strong bounded context for ease of consumption.
